# Project
Galvanize Project Fall 2015

The Arxiv is an academic pre-print respository hosted by Cornell University (www.arxiv.org).  The goal of this project
is to build a paper recommender using the arxiv as the dataset.  The app is currently live at www.arxivexplorer.com.  
There are
two algorithms integrated into the app.  The first is a classification algorithm that predicts the 
subject classification (Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, etc) of a given paper based on the text.  
The algorithm is currently only trained on mathematics papers.  In the future I would like to extend it to 
other subjects.  The second algorithm is a recommendation algorithm, which is currently trained on Number 
Theory papers.
Given a paper, the recommender finds the five most similar number theory papers posted on the arxiv in 2015 
(through August).
In the future I would like the train the recommender on more subjects.
